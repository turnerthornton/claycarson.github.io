Alright, looks like we are up and running with the new site. After hearing discussions on [Accidental Tech Podcast](http://atp.fm/) and wanting to have a place to share mostly links with some commentary, I decided to create a static blog using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I wanted to list the tools, links, and tutorials I used and a couple of helpful links I found along the way.

## Required Tools
- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

 > Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.
 
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Poole](http://getpoole.com/)
- [Joshua Lande's Poole Fork](https://github.com/joshualande/joshualande.github.io)
- [Bigfoot Footnotes](http://www.bigfootjs.com/)

## Resources
- [Smashing Magazine Tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/)
- [Duck Duck Go Search and Styling](http://hardik.org/2013/06/01/stylising-duckduckgo-site-search/)

## Local Tools
- [GitHub Mac 2](https://mac.github.com/)
- [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)

## Mobile Tools
- [Octopage (App Store Link)](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id649843345)
- [Clips](http://www.cleanshavenapps.com/clips/)

## Additional Tools
- [Google Analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/)
- [TextExpander Touch](http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/touch/index.html)

## My Experience

I didn't really want to write a tutorial because, truthfully, I'm surprised I got any of this working at all and don't feel qualified. [This Smashing Magazine tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) was without a doubt the best guide I found.

I wanted to add several features in addition to the default [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) template. One of those features was an Archive page. I discovered [Joshua Lande's Poole Fork](https://github.com/joshualande/joshualande.github.io) that already had an Archive page as well as Analytics so I forked from their and went to work.

The additional features I wanted to have were...

**1. Linked List Posts**
	
I wanted to be able to share links with a different post style than a regular blog post. I have categorized these two posts by 'Link' or by 'Article'

**2. Footnotes**
	
Footnotes are cool and eliminate afterthoughts or clarification within parentheses that interrupt the reader. I used [Bigfoot Footnotes](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) to make this possible.

**3. Navigation Bar**

Simple html list with some css style.

**4. Search**

I wanted people to be able to search the site for whatever they were looking for. I used [Duck Duck Go's](https://duckduckgo.com/search_box) search box and used some of these [styling tips](http://hardik.org/2013/06/01/stylising-duckduckgo-site-search/) to match the look of my site.

I've worked in a restaurant for 7 years and have heard every variation of, "Well done, I don't want no blood left in that steak." and "This isn't cooked, there is still blood." that you could imagine.

>So what is that red liquid you are seeing in red meat?  Red meats, such as beef, are composed of quite a bit of water.  This water, mixed with a protein called myoglobin, ends up comprising most of that red liquid.

The Perfect Race
-----

> 1. It will be a cold day in March (or November).
> 2. The course will be mind-numbingly boring (and perhaps in Poland).
> 3. The pacemakes will form a human wall, setting the state for a time trial.
> 4. The payday will be mind-blowing, but not tethered to a specific race.

The Perfect Runner
-----

> 1. He'll have a [Paula Radcliffe's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paula_Radcliffe) efficiency (and vertical leap).
> 2. He'll be 5'6" and a buck-twenty soaking wet.
> 3. He'll have towering self-confidence and very fast friends.
> 4. He'll have access to things we can't imagine.
> 5. He'll be in his early twenties - and fearless.

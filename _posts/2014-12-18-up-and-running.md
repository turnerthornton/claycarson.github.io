I wanted to list the tools, links, and tutorials I used to get this site up and running. and a couple of helpful links I found along the way.

## Required Tools
- Jekyll[^1]

[^1]: Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

## My Experience

I didn't really want to write a tutorial because, truthfully, I'm surprised I got any of this working at all and don't feel qualified. [This Smashing Magazine tutorial](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) was without a doubt the best guide I found.

I wanted to add several features in addition to the default [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) template. One of those features was an Archive page. I discovered [Joshua Lande's Poole Fork](https://github.com/joshualande/joshualande.github.io) that already had an Archive page as well as Analytics so I forked from their and went to work.

The additional features I wanted to have were...

**1. Linked List Posts**
	
I wanted to be able to share links with a different post style than a regular blog post. I have categorized these two posts by 'Link' or by 'Article'

**2. Footnotes**
	
Footnotes are cool and eliminate afterthoughts or clarification within parentheses that interrupt the reader. I used [Bigfoot Footnotes](http://www.bigfootjs.com/) to make this possible.

**3. Navigation Bar**

Simple html list with some css style.

**4. Archive**

Having an index of all my posts was necessary. I'd like to eventually have a regular ordered list with differentiating post types instead of separating Articles and Links.

I've had a blog of some sorts off and on since late 2006. I never really wrote much except for a few 'tip' type posts for Mac OS X. A couple of years after that I started tweaking things on my site and figured out how to do [Daring Fireball](daringfireball.net) style link posts.

My blog has always been hosted on Wordpress - until now. I am now using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)[^1] and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to create a Static Blog that also happens to be free.

[^1]: Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory [...] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your projectâ€™s page or blog right here from GitHub.

This site will host links that I find interesting as well as a few articles about thoughts I feel are worth sharing. You will find some posts and links dated prior to December 18, 2014. These are just a handful of posts from my old site that I felt were still worth sharing and they gave me a bit of an Archive so the site isn't too bare.

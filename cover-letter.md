<h1>The Things I Think And Do Not Say: The Future Of Our Business</h1>
<p>Leigh Steinberg<br />
2901 W Coast Highway, Ste. 358<br />
Newport Beach, CA 92663</p>
<p>Mr. Steinberg,</p>
<p>You once told me, “Do what you can to set yourself apart from the thousands of others that want to break into this industry.” I believe my video presentation, coupled with my résumé, this cover letter, and my website, leighhiresturner.com, showcase my seriousness in wanting to learn how to be a sports agent from you – the best in the business.</p>
<p>The reason I went to law school was singular – to become an agent. I dreamt of being next to my client on Draft Day, working with GM’s to strike a deal, and researching stats to find comparables to my players. I want to work day in and day out contributing to a company of which I’m proud to be a part; an agency built upon strong values and giving back to the community. You have built a legacy as one of the “good guys” in the industry, and I see no better way to establish myself with the same reputation than to work under your tutelage.</p>
<p>As you know, I have a professional sports background. I worked for the Round Rock Express under Reid Ryan and Jay Miller – two men, much like yourself, who have built their legacies as upstanding, genuine men that always go the extra mile. My time in Round Rock involved coordinating with corporate sponsors to properly fulfill their advertisement goals, creating a familial atmosphere at the ballpark in which each guest felt welcome, and working with my fellow front office members to build a positive office environment day in and day out. Currently, beyond working as a full time attorney, I am employed with TCU Baseball as a production engineer. Working long hours and holidays is par for the course for both attorneys and agents alike, and I am fully prepared to put in whatever hours necessary to become a great agent.</p>
<p>Being an attorney has taught me the importance of building lasting relationships with my clients. To better understand their legal issues, I learn about my clients as individuals, connecting with each on a personal level. The better I understand their day-to-day lives, the better I can represent them in the courtroom. Working as an agent would allow me to apply the interpersonal skills I’ve developed as an attorney directly to athlete clients, fostering relationships and working together to build stronger communities.</p>
<p>I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you about joining your firm in any capacity that may be available. For your information, I have completed my NFLPA Agent Certification application and plan on sitting for the exam in July 2015. Again, I would relish the chance to learn from you while contributing to the goals and resurgence of Steinberg Sports. You are welcome to contact me at any time that is convenient for you.</p>
<p>Thank you again, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
